This is a game kit which gives you an API to make Adventure, RPG, RTS
and RPG games are all-in-one.

The Example.pm files show how to make a game using the CPAN (http://cpan.org)
SDL (version 1.2) packages. See e.g. the file GameExample.pm which
contains a gameloop or the PlayerExample.pm which includes movement for
the Player Character.

Almost every class of the API can be overrided to provide you with game 
mechanics without a drawing system or using ncurses (terminal drawing.) 

There is an separate package for doing the Game's AI. In the first place
you do not need AI but you can steer this by using the update methods in
sprites, enemies and so on. If you really want heavier AI than
conditions and clauses in an update method (see e.g. the file SpriteExample.pm)
you need to have the package HollyGameAI which can be found at
http://holyghost.yellowcouch.org

Derived packages of games can also be found there.
